# TheSpellFactory1.0

This is intended to be a wonderful narrative-based game full of memorable adventures. You start of in search of something known only as the spell factory. Your journey begins in an enchanted forest where you shall soon meet mystical creatures and other-wordly things that will change your life forever.

The game starts of with a tutorial and as you progress you will have to use both your brains and your reflexes to get you through numerous obstacles.

As I am still a beginner when it comes to Android, there may be many better ways to do things that I've done. And apart from code, I also appreciate good ideas for levels.
